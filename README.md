# Analyzing-Video-Data-using-Python-numpy-and-opencv

I try to analyze video using Python, OpenCV, and Numpy.

This idea just came to my mind and then I told myself why not make this happen.

Here I read video file frame by frame as a NumPy array and try to modify a selected frame-like brightness and finally generates a new video using fourcc codec.

Steps:
Import all the necessary libraries and the video file
Then just copy the code and run it on a notebook 
you can change this code to show how things works.
